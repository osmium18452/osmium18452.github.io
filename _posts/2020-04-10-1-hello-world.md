This is the first post of my blog.
Due to the Wuhan pneumonia pandemic, I'm told to stay home and can't go anywhere.
Staying at home is boring so I decided to open a blog and write some thing.
Another important reason for me to open this blog is to record the process of writing an compiler, required by my 
Compilation Principal class. 
So basically, I will post some tutorials (the first may be about how to write a compiler) on this blog.
Random thoughts and technical problems I met may also be posted on this blog.

In 2020/5/24, I decided to re-write the blog in English due to some reasons.
